 * On the StrongARM, "swp" is terminally broken since it bypasses the
 * cache totally.  This means that the cache becomes inconsistent, and,
 * since we use normal loads/stores as well, this is really bad.
 * Typically, this causes oopsen in filp_close, but could have other,
 * more disasterous effects.  There are two work-arounds:
 *  1. Disable interrupts and emulate the atomic swap
 *  2. Clean the cache, perform atomic swap, flush the cache
 *
 * We choose (1) since its the "easiest" to achieve here and is not
 * dependent on the processor type.
