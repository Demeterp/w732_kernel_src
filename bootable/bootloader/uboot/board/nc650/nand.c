 * - cmd_ctrl: hardwarespecific function for accesing control-lines

 * - eccm.ode: mode of ecc, see defines
 * - chip_delay: chip dependent delay for transfering data from array to
 *   read regs (tR)
 * - options: various chip options. They can partly be set to inform
 *   nand_scan about special functionality. See the defines for further
 *   explanation
 * Members with a "?" were not set in the merged testing-NAND branch,
