 * File:         micro.h
 * Description:  This header file contains the function prototype to the
 *               primary interface function for the XSVF player.
 * Usage:        FIRST - PORTS.C
 *               Customize the ports.c function implementations to establish
 *               the correct protocol for communicating with your JTAG ports
 *               (setPort() and readTDOBit()) and tune the waitTime() delay
 *               function.  Also, establish access to the XSVF data source
 *               in the readByte() function.
 *               FINALLY - Call xsvfExecute().
